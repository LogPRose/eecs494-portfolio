  <p>I worked with Alexander Wang. I developed the doors, most of the interactables, the camera, health system, and implemented the movement system. I also handled the tutorial and project managment. We used Unity, C#, and Krita for this project. </p>

  <p>This was our solo project for EECS494, I was responsible for the creation of 99& of this game with the exception of the spike sprite. I wanted to make a 3D platformer that emphasized skill over character progression! I used Unity and C# for this project. </p>
